A program I wrote to transfer screenshots from my connected phone to newly create directories based on the date and then transfer some of them back after I checked which one I want to keep on the phone. 

The code written by me is in the programm.cs.
This console program was written for my personal directory system on my computer and will not work on devices with different directory names.

I am currently working on a winform app that will make this app open to free path choices and more variable directory naming and creating while also having its own app window.
